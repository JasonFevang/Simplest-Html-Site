    <h1>Welcome to the About Page!</h1>
    <p>On this page I will tell you a little bit about what this site is for.</p>
    <p>Basically I'm doing this because I want to see what it's like to structure
        data using html but without using Django templates because I'm realizing
        Django templates are quite complex and I should probably learn regular
        html first.</p>
    <p>This website is created using solely html, I will add css once I learn more
        about css. It's amazing to me that this incredibly simple system can be
    used to create complex websites. All the websites I use are built around html?!</p>
