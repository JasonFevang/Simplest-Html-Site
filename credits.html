    <h1>Welcome to the Credits Page!</h1>
    <p>For this piece of art I would like to give credit to the brilliant
    people at Django who made a website framework that is so powerful but
    also so incredibly complex. Web development is not something to be
    underestimated, it is a very significant thing. My time at ACL is also
    a big contributor to my respect for web development, those are all great
    people. I don't know if I want to do web development for real, but hey I
    think it's pretty sick regardless of if I do it professionally or not.</p>
